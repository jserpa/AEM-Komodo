        <p>Our approach involves a globally coordinated response, comprehensive site preparedness, employee training and communication, and robust business continuity planning:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We have established Incident Response Teams at the corporate level and in key regions to immediately address suspected or confirmed cases of coronavirus that could impact colleagues at our sites. These teams have established protocols to help site leadership escalate appropriately and manage through any issues in a consistent and planful way.</li>
          <li>We are working closely with governments and suppliers to navigate any locally imposed quarantines or restrictions so our sites can remain operational, given the importance of our role is supporting the COVID-19 response and the health care system in general.</li>
          <li>All of our sites are following enhanced cleaning protocols, visitor policies and stringent preventative measures.</li>
          <li>We are restricting travel, encouraging remote work, and instituting social distancing and hygiene protocols.</li>
          <li>All of our operations globally have business continuity plans in place, and we are continually reviewing them, prioritizing orders and shipments for those customers directly involved in containing the spread of COVID-19.</li>
          <li>We are working with suppliers globally to secure continuity of raw materials and critical components, and to facilitate the movement of goods across borders and using available modes of transport.</li>        
        </ul>
        <p>Our measures have been developed in line with guidance from the World Health Organization, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local government agencies. We’ve also convened a panel of global medical experts to give us advice and serve as a sounding board for new protocols and guidance as we roll them out.</p>
        <p>We continue to closely monitor this rapidly evolving situation and any potential impact on our business to ensure we can continue to manufacture and deliver the products and services our customers rely on.</p>

<p>Personal protective equipment is in limited supply due to increased demand. We are working with our manufacturers to secure supply and prioritize shipments for those customers directly involved in containing the spread of COVID-19. This includes first responders, health care workers and customers supporting patient testing and vaccine development.

<p>Our approach involves a globally coordinated response, comprehensive site preparedness, employee training and communication, and robust business continuity planning:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have established Incident Response Teams at the corporate level and in key regions to immediately address suspected or confirmed cases of coronavirus that could impact colleagues at our sites. These teams have established protocols to help site leadership escalate appropriately and manage through any issues in a consistent and planful way.</li>
<li>We are working closely with governments and suppliers to navigate any locally imposed quarantines or restrictions so our sites can remain operational, given the importance of our role is supporting the COVID-19 response and the health care system in general.</li>
<li>All of our sites are following enhanced cleaning protocols, visitor policies and stringent preventative measures.</li>
<li>We are restricting travel, encouraging remote work, and instituting social distancing and hygiene protocols.</li>
<li>All of our operations globally have business continuity plans in place, and we are continually reviewing them, prioritizing orders and shipments for those customers directly involved in containing the spread of COVID-19.</li>
<li>We are working with suppliers globally to secure continuity of raw materials and critical components, and to facilitate the movement of goods across borders and using available modes of transport.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our measures have been developed in line with guidance from the World Health Organization, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local government agencies. We’ve also convened a panel of global medical experts to give us advice and serve as a sounding board for new protocols and guidance as we roll them out.</p>

<p>We are also limiting meetings, restricting visitors at our sites, and encouraging work-from-home situations where possible.
